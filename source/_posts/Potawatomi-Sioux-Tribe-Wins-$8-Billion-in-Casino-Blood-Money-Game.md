#  Potawatomi Sioux Tribe Wins $8 Billion in Casino Blood Money Game

The Potawatomi Sioux Tribe has won a $8 billion in casino blood money game from the state of Wisconsin. It is the single largest Native American gambling windfall in history and will go a long way in helping to improve the impoverished conditions on many reservations.

Wisconsin governor Scott Walker had initially refused to negotiate with the tribe, but was forced to back down after they threatened to launch a statewide referendum campaign to legalize casino gaming. The $8 billion payout is made up of $5.5 billion in profits from the tribe's casinos and $2.5 billion in interest.

"This is a great day for the Potawatomi people," said tribal chairman John Robinson. "Not only have we secured our future, but we have also set an example for other tribes across the country."

The Potawatomi Sioux Tribe has been operating casinos since 1993, when it opened a small bingo hall on its reservation in Kenosha County. The tribe has since expanded its gambling operations to include three full-scale casinos, as well as a poker room and sports book.

In addition to the payout from Wisconsin, the tribe will also receive a one-time payment of $290 million from the state of Michigan as part of a settlement reached last year.

#  Casino Owner Ordered to Pay Millions in Blood Money Game

Casino mogul, Clayton Jennion, has been ordered to pay over $7.5 million in blood money to the family of a man he killed in a game of Russian Roulette. The victim's widow, Elena Ivanova, was awarded the sum by a jury in the US District Court in Florida on Wednesday.

Jennion shot dead Sergey Kuznetsov at his home in Miami in February 2014 during what was supposed to be a harmless game of chance. Jennion claimed that the gun went off accidentally but prosecutors argued that he had intentionally killed Kuznetsov out of greed and malice.

The case has taken years to come to trial and Jennion is facing a possible life sentence if convicted on charges of second degree murder. In addition to the $7.5 million payout, Ivanova is also seeking damages for emotional distress which could amount to millions more.

#  Tribe Claims Victory in Casino Blood Money Game

The Seneca Nation of Indians announced this week that they had successfully prevented the New York State Police from seizing over $1 million in cash from the tribe’s casino.

The state police had alleged that the money was derived from illegal gambling, but the Seneca argued that it was legitimately earned through the casino’s gaming operations.

A spokesman for the tribe said that they were “pleased with the court’s ruling, which confirms what we have said all along – that the money is not proceeds of crime.”

The dispute highlights the often complex and tense relationship between Native American tribes and state and federal governments. Tribes frequently argue that they should be treated as sovereign nations, with their own laws and rights, rather than as wards of the government.

In this case, the tribe appears to have been successful in using its sovereignty to block the state police from seizing its money.

#  Casino Fined for Role in Deadly Blood Money Game

A large, prestigious casino has been fined for its part in a deadly high-stakes blood money game.

The casino is believed to have acted as the financial backer for the game, which resulted in the death of four people.

Investigators say that the game was organized by a criminal syndicate, and that the casino became involved after one of its high-rollers got greedy and demanded a bigger share of the profits.

In addition to being fined, the casino has had its license revoked and faces further investigations.

#  Casino Owner Pleads Guilty in Deadly Blood Money Game

The owner of an illegal casino in Atlantic City has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Prosecutors allege that the casino owner hired a hitman to kill a rival gambling operator, in order to take over his business. The hitman, who was also working as an informant for the FBI, was paid $25,000 to commit the murder. The target was shot and killed in broad daylight, in the middle of a busy street.

Under terms of the plea agreement, the casino owner will serve 20 years in prison, and will forfeit all of his assets. He is also required to testify against the hitman, who is awaiting trial on murder charges. The prosecutor called it “a very significant case”, and said that it would send a message to other criminals that “you can’t come into Atlantic City and conduct your business in this brazen fashion without facing serious consequences”.

When asked why he decided to plead guilty, instead of going to trial and risking a longer sentence, the casino owner said simply: “I am tired of all this”.
