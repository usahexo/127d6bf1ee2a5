#  FFXIV How to Unlock 85 Expert Roulette!

In Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV), progressing through the game is very important. You need to reach level cap, unlock new Heavensward areas and open up new dungeons. The latest content available in FFXIV is the Expert Roulette which is accessed at level 85.

However, many players are struggling to unlock it because they don't know how to complete all the requirements. So if you're one of those people, don't worry because we have created a guide that will show you how to do just that!

The first requirement is to reach level 85. Once you reach this level, speak with the Scions of Fate NPC in Mor Dhona and select "The Duty Finder." Then, select "Expert Roulette" from the list and choose your desired class/job.

The next step is to complete two Binding Coil of Bahamut Turn 5 runs. The good news is that you can use any job/class for these runs since they are not tied to the Expert Roulette like some of the other raids. You can also team up with other players or use a party finder tool such as LFGDoor to join a group quickly.

Once you have completed two Binding Coil of Bahamut Turn 5 runs, the next step is to speak with E-Una-Kotor in Revenant's Toll (x:6 y:11). He is located near the entrance of Cutter's Cry and will give you the key item Unending Journey which allows you to participate in the Expert Roulette.

Congratulations! You have now successfully unlocked the Expert Roulette in FFXIV and can start enjoying all of its challenging new content!

#  Get Rich Quick with Europa Casino's 85 Expert Roulette!

There are many different games you can play at Europa Casino and each one offers its own unique set of potential rewards. However, if you're looking for a game that could potentially see you become a high roller sooner rather than later, then Expert Roulette is the ideal option. There are all sorts of betting options available in this game, so you can find the perfect strategy that works for you and start raking in the wins.

One thing to bear in mind when playing Expert Roulette is that your odds of winning will depend on where you place your bets. For example, betting on a single number will give you a lower chance of winning but also offers the potential for much higher rewards. Conversely, betting on multiple numbers increases your chances of winning but also decreases the pay-out should you manage to do so. With this in mind, it's important to find a balance between risk and reward that you're comfortable with and then stick with it throughout your gaming session.

So how can you make the most of Expert Roulette? Well, by following these simple tips:

1) When starting out, stick to betting on low odds numbers such as 1-18 or 19-36. This will give you a good chance of winning without risking too much money.

2) Once you've got a feel for the game and how it works, start increasing your bets gradually - but only once you're confident that you can afford to lose what you're wagering.

3) Use strategies such as the Martingale system to increase your chances of winning - but always remember to have strict limits in place so that you don't end up losing more money than you intended to.

4) Take advantage of Europa Casino's generous bonuses and promotions - many of which can be used on roulette games - in order to boost your bankroll and increase your chances of walking away with some serious wins.

If you're looking for an exciting and rewarding game to play at Europa Casino, then Expert Roulette is definitely worth considering!

## Roulette: The Game of Chance
Europa Casino's 85 Expert Roulette is an online casino game that allows players to bet on the outcome of a spinning roulette wheel. There are 38 pockets on the wheel, numbered 0 to 36, plus a green pocket marked 00. Players can bet on any of these pockets, or on combinations of them, to win prizes.

The aim of the game is to correctly predict the outcome of the spin and get your bet matched. If you choose the right pocket, your bet will be multiplied by the given odds for that particular pocket. So, for example, if you bet on red and the ball lands in a red pocket, you'll win 36 times your original bet amount.

## The Basics of Roulette
In order to play Europa Casino's 85 Expert Roulette, you first need to open an account and make a deposit. Once you've registered and logged in, click on the Roulette tab found at the top of the screen and choose your desired table from the list displayed. You can then choose how much to bet by clicking on one of the chips at the bottom of the screen.

There are different betting options available depending on which table you're playing at - inside or outside bets. Inside bets are when you place your bet on one or more numbers inside the table layout, while outside bets are placed on sectors of red or black, odd or even, low (1-18) or high (19-36) numbers etc.

When you're happy with your selections, hit the Spin button and watch as the wheel starts spinning. If your chosen combination comes up when the ball lands in a pocket, you'll win according to the paytable displayed next to the wheel. You can also opt to use Auto Play if you want the game to keep running without interruption.

## Tips for Winning at Roulette
There's no surefire way to guarantee winning at roulette every time - it's all down to chance after all! However, there are some tips that may help increase your chances:

* Stick to outside bets - these offer better odds than inside bets.
* Place smaller bets - this will allow you to stay in contention for longer if things don't go your way.
* Remember that red and black switches around every spin, so always split bets between 18 different numbers rather than just 10.
* Use helpful tools like roulette calculators to improve your chances further still!

#  How to Play and Win at Europa Casino's 85 Expert Roulette!

There are a few basic tips that you can use when playing Roulette that will increase your chances of winning.

Tip #1: Choose a European Roulette game over an American Roulette game. The European version has one less slot (0), so the odds are slightly better.

Tip #2: Place outside bets instead of inside bets. An outside bet is a bet on one of the 18 numbers on the edge of the table. An inside bet is a bet on one of the six numbered slots on the table. The odds are better for outside bets.

 Tip #3: Bet on black or red, even or odd, or high or low numbers. These are all simple bets with even odds, so they give you the best chance of winning.
