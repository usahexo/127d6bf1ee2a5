#  Where is Casino Royale Set?

Casino Royale is set in various locations around Europe, with the majority of filming taking place in the Czech Republic. The casino itself is located in Montenegro, and scenes outside of the casino were shot in locations including Prague and Austria.

The opening scenes, outdoors by the river, were filmed near Krivoklat Castle in the Karlštejn district of the Czech Republic. The bridge over which Bond and Vesper ride is the Charles Bridge in Prague. Bond's escape from the casino takes him through a petrol station and onto a train; these scenes were filmed at Innsbruck railway station in Austria.

Meanwhile, following a trail of clues from his past, M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Casino Royale in Montenegro to investigate the activities of Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a terrorist financier. This leads to Bond battling Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game at the casino, eventually culminating in an intense showdown on a construction site.

#  Casino Royale Location: Where is it Filmed?

Casino Royale is an iconic movie filmed in 2006 and set in Montenegro. While the country’s actual name is not mentioned in the film, its well-known coastline and buildings were used to portray the fictional setting.

The movie was shot on location in the Bay of Kotor, Lovćen National Park, Župa Monastery, and other areas. The producers were keen to make use of the natural landscape and its striking beauty to create an authentic and memorable film setting.

Montenegro is a small country located in the Balkans region of southeastern Europe. With a population of just over 600,000, it is the smallest country in the region. But what it lacks in size it makes up for in stunning scenery, with high mountains and dramatic coastal landscapes.

Today, Montenegro is a popular tourist destination, thanks to its unspoiled natural beauty and wealth of historic landmarks. Visitors can enjoy crystal-clear seas, rugged mountain scenery, ancient villages, and medieval castles.

If you’re looking for an off-the-beaten-path destination with plenty of character, then consider traveling to Montenegro. You can explore the country’s beautiful coastline and inland areas while soaking up some history and culture too!
