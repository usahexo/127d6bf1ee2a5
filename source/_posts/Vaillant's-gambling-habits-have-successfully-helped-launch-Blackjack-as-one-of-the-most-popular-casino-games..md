Vaillant's gambling habits have successfully helped launch Blackjack as one of the most popular casino games. Blackjack is a simple game that is played with a decks of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player competes against the dealer, who also has to reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over.

If the player gets 21 points on the first two cards, this is called a blackjack and payouts are usually 3:2. In most cases, if neither the player nor the dealer gets 21, then the winner is the one who has got closest to 21 without going over. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, while an ace can be counted as 1 or 11.

Blackjack is a very popular game in casinos all around the world and there are many different variations of the game available. Some casinos even offer progressive jackpots which can make playing Blackjack even more exciting!

Vaillant is a world-renowned GTD and productivity expert. He has taught his techniques to millions of people through his bestselling books, online courses, and keynote speeches.

Vaillant's approach to productivity is based on two core principles: 1) using a tool to manage your tasks and projects, and 2) breaking down your work into manageable chunks.

The first principle is based on the premise that you can't manage what you don't track. By using a task management tool, you can keep track of everything you need to do and make sure that nothing falls through the cracks.

The second principle is based on the idea that it's easier to break down a large project into smaller tasks than it is to try to tackle the entire project all at once. By breaking down your work into manageable chunks, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

Both of these principles are essential for effective time management. If you want to be productive, you need to have a system for keeping track of your tasks and projects, and you need to break them down into small enough chunks that they don't feel overwhelming.
