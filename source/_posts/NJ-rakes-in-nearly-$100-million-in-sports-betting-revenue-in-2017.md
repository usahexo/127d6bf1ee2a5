#  NJ rakes in nearly $100 million in sports betting revenue in 2017

On Thursday, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that the state had pulled in nearly $100 million in revenue from sports betting in 2017. This figure is a dramatic increase from the $16 million generated in 2016. The news comes as sports betting becomes more and more legal across the United States.

Most of New Jersey’s sports betting revenue came from casinos, particularly those located in Atlantic City. Borgata Casino accounted for nearly half of all bets placed in the state, taking in over $40 million in wagers. Since its inception, sports betting has proven to be a boon for Atlantic City casinos, which have been struggling in recent years.

New Jersey’s rise to the top of the sports betting heap is due largely to a Supreme Court decision last year that overturned a federal law prohibiting most forms of sports betting outside of Nevada. In response to the ruling, New Jersey quickly moved to legalize and regulate the industry. Other states have since followed suit, with Delaware, West Virginia, and Rhode Island all starting up their own sports betting programs.

The surge in sports betting revenue has been good news for states looking to bolster their coffers. However, it has also raised concerns about addiction and other negative consequences associated with gambling. Some experts worry that legalization will lead to an increase in problem gambling rates. Others argue that regulation will help keep gambling addiction in check by providing safeguards like age restrictions and limits on how much money can be bet each day.

So far there is little evidence that legalization has led to increased levels of problem gambling nationwide. Nonetheless, many states are moving ahead with plans to legalize and regulate sports betting, eager to cash in on what is expected to be a multi-billion-dollar industry.

#  NJ state brings in over $1 billion in sports betting revenue since inception

# In May of this year, the New Jersey state government announced that it had collected more than $1 billion in sports betting revenue since the industry was legalized in June of 2018. This impressive figure underscores the explosive popularity of sports betting, both in NJ and nationwide.

# The news also provides valuable insight into the potential economic benefits of legalized sports betting. Since NJ led the charge in legalizing sports betting, other states have followed suit, and it’s likely that this trend will continue as even more states come to realize the potential benefits of this form of entertainment.

# It’s not just state governments that are benefiting from the growth of sports betting; businesses involved in the industry are seeing major profits as well. For example, MGM Resorts International, one of the largest casino operators in the world, saw its stock price surge following the release of its Q2 earnings report. The company credited its strong performance to growth in both its domestic and international gambling businesses, which include sports betting operations.

# It’s clear that legalized sports betting is a major boon for businesses and government alike; not only does it provide a new form of entertainment for consumers, but it also generates significant tax revenue. With so much money on the line, it’s no wonder that more and more states are moving to legalize sports gambling.

#  How much NJ earns off of sports betting Faulkner
_

The Garden State raked in more than $250 million in taxes and fees from sports betting last year, according to an analysis of state revenue by The Associated Press.

New Jersey took in $311 million in total taxes and fees from all forms of gambling in 2018, up from $267 million the year before. That's a 15 percent increase.

State officials said the bump was largely due to the legalization of sports betting in June 2018. That allowed casinos and racetracks to take bets on professional and college games.

 taxed at 10.75%
The state earned $33.5 million in taxes on sports betting last year, or about 10.75% of the total amount wagered. It was the third straight year that New Jersey has reaped more than $30 million in taxes from sports betting.
We are only talking about Casino Sports Books not Off Track Betting or Horse Racing where the State earns very little if anything._
In horse racing, for example, gamblers bet $2.3 billion on races last year at tracks across the country. Hold'em poker tournaments at casinos also tend to have much higher table stakes than traditional roulette or blackjack games. Where New Jersey generates comparatively little tax revenue is from bets made on-line or through bookmakers outside of licensed casino properties _



#  NJ sees big profits from sports gambling

The state of New Jersey stands to make a substantial profit from legal sports gambling, according to a new report.

The report, which was compiled by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, estimates that New Jersey could earn as much as $248 million in annual tax revenue from legalized sports betting. That would be more than enough to cover the estimated $125 million cost of regulating the industry.

“This report confirms what we have known all along: Legalized sports betting is a win for New Jersey taxpayers and our economy,” said Governor Phil Murphy. “I am proud to continue leading the charge to bring this multibillion-dollar industry to our shores and generate much-needed revenue for critical state priorities like education and pension reform.”

New Jersey has been pushing for years to legalize sports betting, arguing that it would help bolster the state’s casino industry. In May 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, opening the door for New Jersey and other states to move forward with legalization efforts.

Since then, New Jersey has been working on regulations for the industry and is now moving ahead with plans to award licenses for Sports Betting Arena LLC locations. The first such location could open as early as July 2019.

The news comes as other states are also moving ahead with legalization efforts. Delaware became the first state to launch legal sports betting following the Supreme Court ruling, while Mississippi and West Virginia are both close to launching their own programs.

#  New Jersey's sports betting industry a major money maker

The state of New Jersey has seen a major increase in revenue from its sports betting industry, with millions of dollars being generated each month.

This is thanks to the Supreme Court’s decision in May 2018 to strike down the federal ban on sports betting, which allowed states to legalize and regulate the activity.

Since then, New Jersey has been among the leaders in terms of revenue generated from sports betting, with casinos and racetracks reporting substantial increases in their take from the industry.

For example, Monmouth Park Racetrack saw its total betting handle increase by more than $7 million in July 2018 compared to July 2017. This was largely due to the introduction of sports betting at the track.

Likewise, Atlantic City’s casinos saw their gaming revenue from all sources increase by more than 12 percent in July 2018 compared to the same month in 2017. This was largely due to an increase in sports betting revenue.

It is estimated that New Jersey’s sports betting industry will generate more than $1 billion in revenue over the next decade. This is good news for the state, as it will help to offset declines in other areas of its economy.
