There is a new bill working its way through the Los Angeles City Council that, if approved, would make poker a legal game in the city. The proposed bill would establish regulations governing poker games and create a permitting process for businesses wishing to offer poker. The regulations would be similar to those currently in place for other casino-style games such as blackjack and roulette.

The driving force behind the bill is Councilman Joe Buscaino, who believes that legalizing poker in Los Angeles could bring much-needed revenue to the city. He is quoted as saying, "This is about jobs and generating revenue for our local economy. Poker is an internationally enjoyed game and we should allow our residents and visitors the opportunity to play without having to leave our city limits."

If approved, the bill would take effect on January 1, 2019. Businesses wishing to offer poker would need to obtain a permit from the city and would be subject to various regulations, including a minimum age requirement of 21 and limits on the number of players per game.

The idea of legalizing poker in Los Angeles has been met with mixed reactions. Some people support it as a way to generate revenue for the city, while others argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. There is also some concern that legalizing poker could pave the way for other forms of gambling, such as casino gambling, to be legalized in California.

So far there has been no official word on whether or not the bill will be approved. If it does pass, it will be up to businesses in Los Angeles to decide whether or not they want to offer poker games.
