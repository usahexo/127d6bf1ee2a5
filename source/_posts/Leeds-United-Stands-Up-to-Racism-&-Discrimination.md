#  Standing Together – Leeds United is Stronger as One

The 2017/2018 season has been one to forget for Leeds United fans. It started with Garry Monk being sacked after a string of bad results and it just went downhill from there. Marcelo Bielsa was brought in as the new head coach in the summer, but he has been unable to turn things around and the club currently sit in 13th place in the Championship table, with just 9 wins from 27 games.

However, things could be about to change at Elland Road. On February 3rd, Andrea Radrizzani (the owner of Leeds United) announced that he had agreed a deal to sell a 50% stake in the club to businessman and venture capitalist, Evangelos Marinakis.

This news was met with mixed reactions from Leeds United supporters. Some were excited about the prospect of Marinakis taking over and helping the club return to the Premier League, while others were worried about his past connections with match-fixing and his alleged involvement in the Greek Crisis.

Marinakis has since addressed these concerns, stating that he is “committed to investing significant resources into Leeds United” and that he wants “to create a winning culture and an environment where all members of our great team – players, coaching staff and everyone at our fantastic club – are proud to be part of”.

He has also promised to keep Marcelo Bielsa as head coach and stated that he believes that “Bielsa is one of the best coaches in football”.

This is good news for Leeds United fans, as Marcelo Bielsa is a very talented coach who could help the club achieve promotion back to the Premier League. He has already made some positive changes since joining Leeds United in the summer, such as changing the team's formation to 4-1-4-1 and signing some good players, including Samuel Saiz and Pablo Hernandez.

With Evangelos Marinakis now on board, Leeds United have a very good chance of achieving promotion back to the Premier League this season. He is a successful businessman who knows how to run a successful football club and he is determined to make Leeds United one of the top clubs in England once again.
