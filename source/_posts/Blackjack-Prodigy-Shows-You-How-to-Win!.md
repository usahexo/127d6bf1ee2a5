#  Blackjack Prodigy Shows You How to Win!

Casinos make billions of dollars every year, but that doesn't mean you can't come out on top. In fact, with a little bit of insider knowledge and some practiced strategies, you can easily win at blackjack!

One person who knows this all too well is blackjack prodigy TommyAngelo. For over 20 years, he has been mastering the game and teaching others how to win big. In this article, we're going to learn some of his most successful strategies so that you can start winning, too!

First and foremost, it's important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. The game is played with six decks of cards, and your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player who goes over 21 automatically loses, regardless of what the dealer has. Blackjacks (an Ace and a 10) are worth 3 points, while other card values remain the same.

To start off, you'll want to place your bets. In general, it's best to bet low when you're just starting out - this will allow you to make more mistakes without losing too much money. Once you've got the hang of things, you can start betting higher amounts.

Now it's time to start playing! The basic strategy for blackjack is as follows:

* If the dealer has an Ace up, hit unless you have 17 or higher.

* If the dealer has a 2 through 6 up, stand if you have 12 or higher. Otherwise hit.

* If the dealer has a 7 or 8 up, stand if you have 17 or higher. Otherwise hit.

* If the dealer has a 9 up, stand if you have 18 or higher. Otherwise hit.

* If the dealer has a 10 or A up, stand if you have 20 or higher. Otherwise hit."

 * If the dealer has a 4,5 or 6 down, double down if your total is 11 or more."

 * If the dealer shows a 3 down, triple down if your total is 9 or more."

Aside from these basic strategies, there are other tips and tricks that TommyAngelo recommends in order to come out ahead at blackjack: 

1) Know when to split pairs - if both cards in your hand are of the same rank (e.g., two 8s), then you can split them into two separate hands and play each one as though it were a new game altogether. This can be a risky move but it can also pay off handsomely if done correctly. 

2) Avoid doubling down - while doubling down can be profitable under certain circumstances, it's also risky since you're committing to another bet which means that you could lose even more money if things don't go your way. 

3) Use card counting techniques - this involves keeping track of which cards have already been played so that you have an idea of what's left in the deck(s). This strategy can give you an edge over the casino since they aren't privy to the same information that you are (assuming that they're not using card counting software themselves!). 

4) Stay disciplined - one of the biggest mistakes players make is overextending themselves by making huge bets when they're on a winning streak or doubling down when they shouldn't be. It's important to stay calm and collected no matter what happens during a game in order to make rational decisions that will increase your chances of winning."

There is some debate over where blackjack actually originated. What we do know for sure, however, is that the game has been around since the seventeenth century and that it has been enjoyed by millions of players ever since. 

If you love the excitement and anticipation of blackjack, but have never played before, don't worry. This guide is here to teach you everything you need to know in order to get started. 

In blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer. You can do this by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a "blackjack"), or by taking as many cards as necessary until you reach 21 or come closer to 21 than the dealer. Each card has a value assigned to it, as shown in the table below: 

CARD VALUE
A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 JACK QUEEN KING ASS 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

The ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what would be most advantageous for you at the time. 

Before you start playing, there are a few things you should know about the rules of blackjack. In general, there are a few key things to keep in mind: 
-You must hit if your total is less than 17; 
-You may hit as many times as you like (or until you bust - go over 21); 
-The dealer must hit on totals of 16 or less and stand on totals of 17 or more; and 
-There are different betting options available, which we will discuss later. 

Now that you understand the basics of how to play, let's take a look at some basic tips for improving your chances of winning: 
-Never split 5s or 10s; 
-If you have an Ace and a 6, hit; if you have an Ace and a 7, stand; 

-If the dealer has an Ace showing, bet low; 
-When counting cards, remember that an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11; and finally 

-Remember that practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better your odds will become.
