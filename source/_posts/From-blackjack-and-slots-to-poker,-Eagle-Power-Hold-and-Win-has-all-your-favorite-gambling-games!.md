#  There's never been a better time to try your luck at the casino – Eagle Power Hold and Win is now legal in Nevada!

Nevada has become the latest state to legalize casino-style gambling on horse races, as Governor Brian Sandoval has signed a bill into law that allows for "Eagle Power Hold and Win" wagers.

This new form of gambling, which was successfully tested in a handful of Nevada casinos late last year, allows players to make a bet on a horse to win, and then hold onto the ticket until the end of the race. If the horse crosses the finish line first, the player collects their winnings; if not, they lose their bet.

Horse racing fans were eagerly awaiting the passage of this bill, as it offers them another way to gamble on their favorite sport. And for those who are new to horse racing, Eagle Power Hold and Win is a great way to get started – it's easy to understand and offers some of the best odds in town.

So what are you waiting for? Head down to your nearest Nevada casino and give Eagle Power Hold and Win a try!

In Eagle Power Hold and Win, you compete against other players to see who can hold onto their eagle the longest.

If your eagle flies away, you lose the round and whatever chips you've wagered.

The longer you can keep your eagle in control, the more chips you'll earn. There are also bonus rounds available, which offer even bigger payouts. So be sure to keep an eye out for them!
