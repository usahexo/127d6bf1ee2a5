            <h1 id="Texas-Again-Looks-To-Dodge-Roulette-Supplier"><a href="#Texas-Again-Looks-To-Dodge-Roulette-Supplier" class="headerlink" title="Texas Again Looks To Dodge Roulette Supplier"></a>Texas Again Looks To Dodge Roulette Supplier</h1><p>In the aftermath of reports that a Texas county purchasing agent may have engaged in bid rigging with a supplier of roulette wheels, county officials are once again looking for an alternate supplier.</p>
<p>The potential scandal began to unfold earlier this year, when the Harris County Purchasing Department put out a request for proposals (RFP) for new roulette wheels for the county’s three racetracks. Officials with Philadelphia-based International Game Technology (IGT), the incumbent supplier, contacted the purchasing agent and offered to withdraw from the bidding process if IGT was given the contract.</p>
<p>The agent allegedly agreed, and IGT was subsequently awarded the $130,000 contract without having to submit a proposal.</p>
<p>An investigation into the matter was launched earlier this month after a local newspaper ran a story about the alleged collusion. The prosecutor’s office is now considering whether to bring criminal charges against the purchasing agent.</p>
<p>In light of the controversy, county officials are now looking for an alternate supplier and have issued a new RFP for roulette wheels. The deadline for submissions is August 22.</p>
<p>IGT has not yet commented on the allegations.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Legislature-Could-Take-Up-Roulette-Supplier-Issue-Again"><a href="#Texas-Legislature-Could-Take-Up-Roulette-Supplier-Issue-Again" class="headerlink" title="Texas Legislature Could Take Up Roulette Supplier Issue Again"></a>Texas Legislature Could Take Up Roulette Supplier Issue Again</h1><p>In the waning days of the 86th Texas Legislature, lawmakers were still hard at work on a number of bills. One such bill that was still making its way through the process was House Bill 2154, which would have allowed casinos in Texas.</p>
<p>The bill had been passed by the House in April, but ran into trouble in the Senate. The upper chamber ended up amending and passing its own version of the legislation, which differed from the House bill in a few key ways.</p>
<p>One of those differences was that the Senate bill would have allowed companies that supply roulette wheels and other casino equipment to do business in Texas. The House Bill did not have that provision.</p>
<p>Now, with both chambers having passed their own versions of the bill, a conference committee has been appointed to hash out the differences and come up with a final version of the legislation.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers are already voicing concerns about the roulette wheel supplier provision in the Senate bill. Some say it could create an unfair advantage for certain businesses, while others argue that it could put Texans’ safety at risk.</p>
<p>The chairman of the conference committee, state Rep. Dustin Burrows, said he is open to discussions about the provision but added that he has some reservations about it.</p>
<p>“I think there’s merit to having that discussion because we want to make sure that everyone who is playing this game is playing on a level playing field,” he said. “But I also want to be very cognizant of making sure we don’t put Texans in harm’s way by doing something like this.”</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether the roulette wheel supplier provision will be included in the final version of HB 2154 that comes out of conference committee. If it is included, it is likely to face further scrutiny and debate as legislators move closer to a vote on the measure.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-House-Passes-Bill-to-Keep-Roulette-Supplier-Out"><a href="#Texas-House-Passes-Bill-to-Keep-Roulette-Supplier-Out" class="headerlink" title="Texas House Passes Bill to Keep Roulette Supplier Out"></a>Texas House Passes Bill to Keep Roulette Supplier Out</h1><p>A bill that would ban Texas casinos from using suppliers based in other states has passed the Texas House.</p>
<p>The measure, HB 1435, was authored by Representative Jose Menendez and co-sponsored by Representatives Rafael Anchia, Roberto Alonzo, Celia Israel, and Terry Canales. It prohibits casinos from contracting with businesses that are not based in Texas.</p>
<p>The bill is a response to Curacao-based Absolute Entertainment reportedly seeking a contract with the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino in Eagle Pass. The casino is seeking to partner with a gaming supplier that is not based in Texas as a way of circumventing state law.</p>
<p>“This legislation will stop out-of-state companies from trying to take advantage of our local businesses and penalize casinos who try to do business with them,” said Representative Menendez. “Texas businesses should have the opportunity to compete for casino contracts and create jobs in our state.”</p>
<p>Representative Alonzo added, “This legislation levels the playing field for Texas businesses and ensures that our taxpayers benefit from casino contracts, rather than out-of-state companies.”</p>
<p>HB 1435 now heads to the Senate for consideration.</p>

<p>State defiant as roulette supplier eyes Texas</p>
<p>Amid the deliberations on casinos in the state of Texas, a little-known supplier of roulette wheels and tables has emerged, apparently unfazed by the prospect of competition.</p>
<p>The company, which prefers to remain anonymous, is said to be supplying gaming equipment to a number of casinos in other states and is now eyeing Texas as its next potential market.</p>
<p>The suppler insists that it can provide high-quality equipment that will meet the stringent requirements of the Texas gaming authorities. It also says that its prices are highly competitive and that it can offer customised solutions for each casino.</p>
<p>This could be an interesting development in the debate over casinos in Texas, as it could force the authorities to take a stand on this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Holds-Firm-as-Roulette-Supplier-Moves-In"><a href="#Texas-Holds-Firm-as-Roulette-Supplier-Moves-In" class="headerlink" title="Texas Holds Firm as Roulette Supplier Moves In"></a>Texas Holds Firm as Roulette Supplier Moves In</h1><p><em>As a major supplier of roulette wheels moves in, many Texas establishments are standing their ground.</em></p>
<p>HOUSTON <em>Despite the recent news that a major casino supplier is moving into the Texas market, many of the state’s casinos are refusing to switch from their current providers. The new supplier, International Gaming Technology (IGT), announced last week that it will be supplying its new Veriwheel product to several major casinos in the state.</em></p>
<p>The decision by IGT to enter the Texas market has sparked a heated debate between casinos and their current suppliers. While some establishments have already announced plans to switch to IGT’s products, others are holding firm and say they are happy with the equipment they currently have.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working with our current supplier for several years now and we’ve been very happy with the service and products they’ve provided us,” said Tracey Shipman, marketing director for Dewey’s Casino in Houston. “We have no intention of switching to IGT just because they’re entering the market.”</p>
<p>Dewey’s is just one of several casinos in Texas that is resisting IGT’s push into the market. Other casinos that have stated they will not be making a switch include Lucky Eagle Casino in Rochester, Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino in Eagle Pass, and Naskila Entertainment in Livingston.</p>
<p>IGT has responded to the resistance by pledging to offer its Veriwheel product at a lower price point than its competitors. The company says that its product offers features that are not available with other roulette wheels on the market.</p>
<p>Despite the competitive pricing from IGT, many casinos are still not interested in making a switch. Officials from Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder, Golden Nugget Lake Charles, and L’Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles all confirmed this week that they will not be making a change.</p>
